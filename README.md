## Key Insights from the Analysis 

 Sales performance over time: 
1) the store had the highest sales in April with **20.26%** 
2) The store made the highest sales in quarter two with **54.66%**
   
 Sales Performance by Region:
1) East has the highest sales at **30.77%**
2) South has the lowest sales at **18.56%**

 Sales Performance by Product Category:
1) Technology has the highest sales with **37.01%**
2) The office supplies have the lowest sales with **28.65%**

 Sales Performance by Customer Segments:
1) Corporate customers have the highest sales with **34.18%** 
2) small business customers have the lowest by **20.8%.**

## Observation
1) Small businesses exhibit the lowest sales among customer segments but generate the highest profits. The excessive profit margins on small business items result in higher prices, leading to poor sales as the costs become too prohibitive for customers.

## Recommendations
After careful analysis of the dataset, I made the following recommendations:
1) Reduce the profit margins for small business segments to make prices more attractive and boost sales. Additionally, replace the Regional Manager for the South, as their performance appears inadequate.
